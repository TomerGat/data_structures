# data_structures
Implementations of data structures and algorithms related to them

Linked List:
1. Implementation of linked list using a struct representing each node in a list. Each struct contains an int value and a pointer to the next node in the list.
2. Recursive implementation of linked list sort algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort).
3. Reverse function for a linked list.
4. Function checking if a linked list represents a palindrome
