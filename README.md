# data_structures
Implementations of data structures and algorithms related to them

Linked List:
1. Implementation of linked list using a struct representing each node in a list. Each struct contains an int value and a pointer to the next node in the list.
2. Recursive implementation of linked list sort algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort).
3. Reverse function for a linked list.
4. Recursive function checking if a linked list represents a palindrome

Binary Tree:
1. Implementation of binary tree using a struct representing each binNode in a tree. Each struct contains an int value and two pointers, pointing to the right and left leaves that branch off from the binNode.

2. Recursive search function that searches the tree for a certain value.
3. Recursive function that finds the longest sequence of nodes in a tree.
4. Recursive function that mirrors the shape of a binary tree.
